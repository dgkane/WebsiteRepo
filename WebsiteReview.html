<H1>PC Pro: Website review</H1>
</HR>

<P>
PC Pro is a monthly magazine published in the UK focusing on business hardware and software with an average monthly circulation of around 55,000[1]. Its website, http://www.pcpro.co.uk/, is updated daily and averages 1 million unique users a month, according to its publisher[2]. This article will analyse and review the range of technologies used by the website on both the client and the server side.

</P>

<P>
The front page(fig. 1 & 2) appears a little cluttered, and could benefit from more whitespace between the various sections to improve readability[3]. This is in contrast to the print magazine, which has a minimalist design with prevalent whitespace(fig. 3). Paul Boag cites a phenomenon called 'The fold' where designers mistakenly[4] believe users do not scroll and a general desire to communicate too much information at once[5] as common reasons for cluttered webpages, and the website's wide range of content suggests the latter may be the case here. The mix of both static and animated graphics for both advertisements and images relevant to the articles could be perceived as confusing.
</P>

<P>
The row of tabs across the top provide quick one-click access to the desired type of content, which is consistent in layout and displayed identically across all major browsers tested in Windows (IE9, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari), Ubuntu Linux (Firefox, Chromium, Epiphany) and Android (Stock Android browser, Dolphin Mini), although since all the page elements are set in pixel size, browsing on a smaller smartphone screen requires either excessive scrolling or zooming out to an unreadable level.

WebPageTest at <A HREF="http://www.webpagetest.org">www.webpagetest.org</A> was used to compare how quickly the site loaded on IE9, Chrome and Firefox using a typical DSL 1.5Mbps connection. 10 runs were performed, with the figures in the table below being an average. The test location was specified as Dublin, Ireland, since it was the best compromise between variety of testable browsers and distance from the PC Pro server, which is located in the UK. 'Start render' measures the point in time when the website becomes viewable on the client machine.

Since the site is rendered almost identically across browsers, it would seem that the site is best viewed in IE9 as it loaded the page faster almost across the board, though Chrome loaded the whole document slightly more quickly than IE9. In practical terms, there is little noticeable difference between site load speed in IE9 and Chrome, although Firefox felt noticeably a little more sluggish.
<P>

<P>
<H2>Site layout and structure</H2>
<P>

<P>
This consistency across browsers suggests extensive use of stylesheets, seven of which are defined in the index page's HTML code. The Document Type Declaration (DTD) is HTML 4.01 Strict, which does not contain code for deprecated presentation attributes or elements as defined by the W3C[6], which means all presentational elements are defined in cascading stylesheets. This suggests the designers are emphasising compatibility, which is in keeping with the magazine's coverage of a wide variety of systems. '/css/reset.css' defines default behaviours of some HTML tags in order to apply a conistent style, while '/css/corelayout.css' and '/css/screen.css' divide and further subdivide the screen into specified areas, and '/css/typrography.css' is concerned with applying styles to fonts. This modular approach to styling the website avoids having one big, unweildy style sheet that becomes difficult to edit. There is evidence in the index page's source code of stylesheets having had existed for particular versions of IE:
</P>

<P>
&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt;<BR>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://sprites.pcpro.co.uk/css/ie6/bargraph.css" type="text/css" media="screen" title="no title" charset="utf-8"/&gt;<BR>
&lt;![endif]--&gt;<BR>
&lt;!--[if IE 7]&gt;<BR>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://sprites.pcpro.co.uk/css/ie7/bargraph.css" type="text/css" media="screen" title="no title" charset="utf-8"/&gt;<BR>
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
<P>
</P>

<P>
These are now commented out in the code. That there is now no need for browser-specific code emphasises the importance of stylesheets in compatibility. A problem arises on small screens or at low resolutionsas '/css/corelayout.css' stylesheet divides the page into areas set in pixel width, which means the interface doesn't scale down. The areas could have been set by proportion of the screen size, though that would also require scaling down text and graphics.
</P>

<P>
The &lt;html&gt; tag contains an xmlns declaration for the XHTML namespace. XHTML is a standard reccommended by W3C in 2000 and combines conventional HTML tags with XML's ability to let the designer specify their own tags to meet their own particular needs[7]. It improves upon HTML by adding support for additional character sets and scientific notation.
</P>

<P>
<H2>Technologies for dynamic content</H2>
</P>

<P>
There is extensive use of JavaScript on the site. Other tools for creating dynamic web content exist - such as Flash, which is famously unspported by iOS[8]. JavaScript, though, is supported by virtually all major browsers, which makes it a good choice for a site where compatibility is priority.  Some scripts are executed within the HTML document - for example, the first statement within the &lt;HEAD&gt; tag of the homepage
</P>

<P>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;var _sf_startpt=(new Date()).getTime()&lt;/script&gt;
</P>

<P>
assigns the current time to a variable _sf_startpt, whereas
</P>

<P> 
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://sprites.pcpro.co.uk/vendor-js/jQuery/jcarousellite_1.0.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</P>

<P>
calls a seperate JavaScript program from another directory on the server that displays a carousel-style widget for navigating multiple images. Although the ads are dynamic, the text and images used for the article links on the homepage are hard-coded in the HTML and will have to be updated by hand. For the homepage to be truly dynamic, JavaScript or CGI could have been used to update the homepage automatically based on date or relevance metadata given to individual article pages. The disadvantage of this would be slower load times and excluding users who use browsers not compatible with JavaScript or choose to disable JavaScript in their browser. As it stands, the site is perfectly usable with JavaScript disabled in the browser; the carousel News widget and Search function will not function, and the Sponsored Links window near the bottom of the page does not appear(fig. 5).

</P>

<P>
The site's <A HREF="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/forum/">forums</A> use the popular internet forum package phpBB written in the server-side scripting language PHP. In April 2007, PHP was available on around 1.2 million servers and used in over 20 million domains[9] and is the 6th most popular programming language in October 2012 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index[10]. It is ideal for templating HTML pages, which makes it a good choice for pages that use the same element over and over again, such as message boards. For example, a file header.inc might contain code for the header of a board post, and another file footer.inc could contain code for the footer. PHP can be embedded in another HTML document to combine them:
</P>

<P>
&lt;?php require('header.inc'); ?&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;Message body&lt;/P&gt;<BR>
&lt;?php require('footer.inc'); ?&gt;
</P>

<P>
While most links on the site appear to be static URLs, there is evidence of HTML code passing arguments to server-side PHP programs in the Forums section. The line
</P>

<P>
109 &lt;link href="./style.php?id=2&amp;lang=en&amp;sid=3299a6a53c076d7da0505fbcb1b177c1" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen, projection" /&gt;
</P>

<P>
links to a stylesheet that has parameters id, lang and sid, which suggests it contains a user's forum preferences. Actions such as viewing forums and friends lists involve passing parameters to PHP.
Like the 'Features' page, the 'Blogs' page uses XHTML 1.0 as a DTD and there is evidence of JavaScript being used to access remote RSS feeds.
</P>

<P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
</P>

<P>
PC Pro covers a myriad of devices as a magazine, so it makes sense that its website has an emphasis on compatibility, incorporating languages such as XHTML, JavaScript and PHP which are well supported by browsers. The scripting is not intrusive; apart from adverts, JavaScript is only used on a few site elements that assist navigation (news widget and search function) and has no discernible effect on page load times, and PHP is mostly confined to the forum. The consistency in looks between browsers is partly due to some rigid coding that could be improved by making it more scaleable to different screen resolutions and introducing some scripting to automatically show new items or a user's personal preferences in the news feed rather than coding the links by hand.
